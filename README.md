#Challenge 10#

The cryptocurrency portfolio proposal leverages Python 3.10+ and utilizes the following project libraries and dependencies:

* JupyterLab
* Pandas
* sci-kit learn - KMeans, PCA, and StandardScaler 
* pathlib
* hvplot

To run this analysis, simply clone the repository or download the files and launch the **crypto_investments.ipynb** in JupyterLab. After launching JupyterLab, navigate to the **crypto_investments.ipynb** file and run all cells to see the results.

The analysis involves assembling cryptocurrency portfolios using Python and unsupervised learning methods to cluster cryptocurrencies by their performance in different time periods. The steps involved include importing the cryptocurrency dataset with periodic performance metrics, identifying the performance metrics most related to clustering, finding a reasonable cluster size, clustering the data using the K-means algorithm, optimizing clusters with Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and graphing and interpreting the results.
